# About
This is the code developed for my undergrad's final thesis research, CNC Milling Machining Time Estimation with Artificial Neural Networks. This code is for academic purpose only and the thesis paper is not to be published whatsoever. The research purpose is to develop models that are capable to accurately estimate the machining time of a CNC Milling workstation, given machining parameters and project data. A simple GUI app prototype is also developed to be use for production.

I included the notebook file in case you want to view the result direcly from the github page
